  from: "September 2022"
  to: "Present"
  highlights:
    - While at Swytch, I led the full development lifecycle of a bespoke ERP system, including a live warehouse platform for stock management, international dangerous goods shipping, stock forecasting, returns handling and anything else that was needed. <a href="/projects/swytchtools" target="_blank">See more about this project.</a>
    - I worked closely with the rest of the business to convert ideas, painpoints and timesinks into a cohesive platform that transformed how we operated, taking on-time deliveries from 30% to 70% while reducing our operational costs.
    - I found and implemented multiple open source projects to quickly enable things like business intelligence and rapid AI integration, letting us deliver maximum impact with minimum budget and effort. Through delivering training, I was able to increase the impact of these tools and allow users to independently improve their own workflows.
    - Through architecting a scalable and robust system, I enabled multiple daily releases and rapid iterations on features, allowing us to deliver exactly what the company needed and to pivot when necessary. For example, through a just-in-time stock pivot, we were able to reduce stock overheads by Â£1M.
    - With careful planning and putting users and their needs at the heart of everything I did, as well as monitoring the entire lifecycle of the project, we were able to see the impact of new features immediately and carry the momentum forward to generate new ideas.
    - Keeping up to date with the latest technologies, I was able to quickly implement and deploy new features and tools, such as using large language models to automate parts of customer support.
    - Through constant personal learning and development, I was able to improve communications with the rest of the business, ensuring everyone was on the same page, the most important features were always prioritised and that others knew what was being done and when.
    - Using ideas from well-established books such as 'The Phoenix Project' and 'Turn the ship around', I fostered and maintained a culture of continuous learning and development, allowing us to deliver the best possible experience for our users.

    - As the first hire at ElbowSpace, I played an integral part in managing the direction of the company, gaining a much wider experience of running a startup and the opportunities and pitfalls involved.

    - I collaborated with the core CMS developers to ensure a smoother developer experience and quicker results for the customer. This included both using the core CMS code to extend what customers needed, as well as opening lines of communication to the core CMS developers to make sure they were able to meet the needs of customers and proactively improve the platform.
    - I took the initiative to improve tooling around the CMS, including adding Docker support and extending documentation for a better developer experience.

    - I was initially hired as a student for data entry, but quickly spotted opportunities for systems improvements and quickly became a developer, going full time immediately after my degree.
    - I developed multiple bespoke platforms and tools to reduce cost and friction in day-to-day work, allowing the union to focus on the more important things for students.
    - I independently spotted and implemented process improvements throughout the organisation. One of the largest projects involved a greenfield project to transform how student groups were managed and how they interacted with the union, leading to a 50% reduction in the time spent annually.
    - As the sole developer in a company of around 200 people, I was able to gain a wide range of experience in many different areas and languages. I was also able to truly understand how developers can help organisations whose main focus is not IT and software.
