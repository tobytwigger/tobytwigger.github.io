    - Led the full development lifecycle of a bespoke ERP system, including a warehouse management platform for stock management and international dangerous goods shipping, stock forecasting, returns handling and lots more. <a href="/projects/swytchtools" target="_blank">See more about this project.</a>
    - Through careful architecting of a scalable and robust system, alongside prioritising delivering value quickly, I enabled multiple daily releases and rapid iterations on features, allowing us to deliver exactly what was needed. For example, it enabled a just-in-time stock pivot, reducing stock overheads by £1M.
    - Through putting users first, I was able to convert ideas and painpoints into a cohesive platform that transformed operations, taking on-time deliveries from 30% to 70% while reducing operational costs.
    - Fostered a culture of continuous learning and development, applying principles from “The Phoenix Project” and “Turn the Ship Around,” mentoring a junior developer effectively, and improving communication to align priorities across the business.
    - Keeping up to date with the latest technologies, I was able to quickly implement and deploy new features and tools, such as using large language models to automate parts of customer support and augment existing workflows. Through delivering training, I was able to increase the impact of these tools and empower users to independently improve their own workflows on minimal budget.
