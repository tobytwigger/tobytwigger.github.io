  highlights:
    - Dissertation involved designing a neural network using Tensorflow to analyze data from the Large Hadron Collider to classify particle collisions. <a href="/assets/docs/Final_Year_Project_Report.pdf" target="_blank">View paper</a>
    - Multiple coding modules, involving highly optimised programs running on supercomputers.
    - Through a rigorous course of study alongside web development jobs, I was able to gain strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as a deep understanding of the underlying concepts of physics and mathematics and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.
    - Since I self-taught myself to code, I know exactly how I learn and how I can learn quickly, and therefore I was able to quickly adapt to new technologies and frameworks I hadn't seen before.
