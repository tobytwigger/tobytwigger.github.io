# **Contracting & Consultancy**

I offer **part-time web development contracting and technical consultancy** for startups and small teams that need
experienced input **without the cost or commitment of a full-time hire**.

If you need help **unblocking a project**, **validating technical decisions**, or **delivering a well-scoped piece of work**,
I can usually add value quickly with minimal ramp-up.

---

## **How I Can Help**

I focus on work that can be delivered **efficiently, asynchronously, and with clear outcomes** - ideal for teams that want
senior engineering input without heavy process or overhead.

### 🧠 Technical Consultancy & Advice
- Architecture reviews and second opinions
- Technology choices (frameworks, databases, hosting, cloud)
- System design and technical strategy
- Performance, scalability, and maintainability audits
- Codebase health checks and refactoring plans
- “Is this a good idea?” technical sanity checks
- Helping unblock teams that are stuck or moving slowly

### 🛠️ Short-Form Development Work
- Well-defined features or fixes
- Prototyping and proof-of-concept builds
- Deep codebase reviews with actionable feedback
- Refactoring or stabilising existing systems
- Internal tools and automation
- API design and backend development
- Technical debt reduction

### 📈 Early-Stage & Founder Support
- Supporting non-technical or semi-technical founders
- Turning vague ideas into concrete, buildable plans
- Defining MVP scope and delivery strategy
- Reviewing contractor or agency work before it goes live

## **Typical Engagements**

- **Part-time & flexible** - evenings / limited weekly hours
- **Async-friendly** - minimal meetings, clear written communication
- **Outcome-focused** - small, well-scoped engagements
- **Pragmatic** - simple solutions over unnecessary complexity

I’m particularly well-suited to **short engagements**, light ongoing advisory roles, or projects that benefit from **senior
engineering input without long-term commitment**.

---

## **What You Get**

When you work with me, you can expect:

- Clear, honest communication
- Pragmatic recommendations grounded in real-world experience
- Production-minded code and technical decisions
- Thorough documentation and clean handover
- Respect for your time, budget, and existing systems

I aim to leave things better than I found them - even on very small engagements.

---

## **Technologies & Experience**

I’m a **full-stack web developer** with experience across:

- Backend systems and APIs
- Web applications and internal tools
- Data-driven applications and analytics
- Cloud-hosted, production systems

My background spans startups and established organisations, and I’m comfortable stepping into unfamiliar codebases and
making sense of them quickly.

---

## **Availability & Rates**

- **Rate:** Normally £60 / hour
- **Availability:** Part-time, limited slots
- **Location:** Remote (UK time zone preferred)

I’m happy to have a short, no-obligation conversation to see whether something is a good fit.

I’ll let you know quickly whether it’s something I can take on.
