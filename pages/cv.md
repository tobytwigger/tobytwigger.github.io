# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>


I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building robust, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. Over 
the years, I’ve led projects ranging from bespoke ERP systems to public-facing platforms, consistently delivering 
clean, maintainable code that empowers teams and improves operations. Whether architecting a sales forecasting tool or 
contributing to open-source Laravel packages, I take pride in thoughtful design, test coverage, and documentation. 
My work spans early-stage startups to established organisations, and I thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments where I can help shape both product and process.

Outside of coding, I’m deeply motivated by projects that contribute to the public good - particularly those that encourage sustainable transport and help more people access nature. I’m an avid cyclist and hiker, and I bring that same sense of exploration and persistence to my development work. I care about making technology approachable, effective, and inclusive, and I’m always looking to work with teams who share a mission-driven ethos. Whether I’m integrating AI to streamline support workflows or debugging under a headlamp on a camping trip, I aim to leave systems - and the world - a little better than I found them.
