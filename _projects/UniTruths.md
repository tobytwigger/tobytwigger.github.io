# UniTruths

Uni-Truths is a Facebook community management platform for university students. It was created off the back of the 
closure of Yik-Yak, a popular anonymous, location-based social media platform.

Using Uni-Truths, we were able to create a moderation platform for students to manage their own communities. 
Starting at the University of Bristol, Uni-Truths is now used internationally by a large number of students.

The tech is now maintained but not actively developed.

## Tech Stack

Uni-Truths was built using Laravel, Vue and Bootstrap. It was originally built on Laravel 5.7, but has since been 
upgraded to keep up with the latest Laravel features.

## Features

- Supportive pipeline for posting 'confessions' to a Facebook page, from submission to posting.
- Moderation tools, including AI for detecting spam and abuse.
- Automatic post scheduling to optimise engagement.
- Extensive permission management to hold the community to a strict code of conduct.
