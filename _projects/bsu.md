# Bristol SU Portal

The portal is a flexible online platform that automates and digitises services.
- Customisable – You can automate any service, connect it to existing or new systems, and deploy it.
- Modular design – Services are built from “modules” (small page groups) that perform actions like filling forms, uploading files, or making payments. Combine them into a process to automate services.
- Service management tools – Includes progress tracking, user access control, and automated emails.

For developers:
- Built on Laravel, making it easy to create new modules or connect to third-party tools like CRMs.
- Flexible user management works with your current data sources.
- A full API is provided for controlling users, services, and automations, with a custom API for each service you create.

In short – It’s a one-stop system for building, automating, and managing services, with tools for both non-technical users and developers.

## Features

- Framework for building new modules and extending the portal
- Advanced usergroup management using filters and segmentation to deliver processes accurately
- A trigger/action workflow for reacting to interactions with the site
