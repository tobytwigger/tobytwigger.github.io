# GPS Vault

## Overview

GPS Vault was a personal side project aimed at exploring GPS data management and web mapping. I started it to 
experiment with features I wasn't satisfied with in existing tools, such as multi-day tour planning, selective route 
syncing, and secure data backups. While the project is no longer maintained and was never fully completed, it provided valuable experience with geospatial data and modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- Laravel (backend)
- Vue, Inertia, Vuetify (frontend)
